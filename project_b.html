                    <h2>Project Context</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">For this project, we worked with a companyâ€˜s website, Container Brewing.
                        Container Brewing is a
                        fictitious company that produce high-end beers. During the project, we developed the intended
                        user, style guide, visual design, interactions, and responsive in multi platform for the
                        website.

                <h2>Stage 1</h2>
                <p>Before making the webpage's style guide, we did research on the existing brands and their target
                    audiences. We integrated themes of different brands and came out with our own brand: Container
                    Brewing. After the research, we created the style guide that contains the main features and
                    elements of the webpage.

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Stage 2</h2>
                <p>Once we finished style guide, we begin to structure what we need for the webpage. As we came out
                    with four different pages for the webpage, we begin to sketch different layout and implement them
                    to the actual mockup by applying HTML and CSS.

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Stage 3</h2>
                <p>After we completed the structure and appearance of the webpage, we begin to add responsive for the
                    webpage. The reason is that we want to focusing on the accessbility for all potential users, so
                    they can access from different size of devices. We also focused on the user experience such as
                    interaction cues, and affordances.

                <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                <p>At the end, the result went good that we received positive feedback from the instructor and one of
                    the highest grade in the class. During the project, I experienced many technique issues and
                    accessbility issues. However, the project pushed me to develop my problem solving skills which
                    allows me to solve all these kind of issues.
