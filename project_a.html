                    <h2>Project Context</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">For this project, we worked with an existing mobile application,
                        Citymapper, and designed a new
                        feature for it. Citymapper is transit and mapping app that helps users navigate around the city
                        and
                        guide them on transportation. Citymapper can be used on multiple platforms and is available for
                        different major cities around the world.

                <h2>Stage 1</h2>
                <p>This project begin with researching and understanding of the existing app: Citymapper.
                    After we learned the interface inside and out, we interviewed multiple potential and primary
                    users to do user-test and take notes on their experiences. In result, this way helped me to learn
                    more
                    about the application itself and to understand users' needs.

                <h2>Stage 2</h2>

                <p>After stage 1's research, I brainstormed an AR camera navigation feature that help pedestrians
                    navigate around cities by showing them digital street signs and
                    virtual arrows overlaid on the sidewalk to show which way to walk. However, since the course is
                    focusing on interface design, AR camera navigation feature is too simple for the course
                    requirenment.

                <h2>Stage 3</h2>
                <p>After more researches, we decide to create a new feature, a weather feature.
                    The main aspect of the weather feature that serves the most important function is showing the user
                    alternative sheltered routes. Not only will users be able to select and plan their quickest route
                    to their destinations, they can now find the quickest sheltered alternative to aid their travels
                    when unexpected rain or snow hits during the day.

                <h3>Select Quickest/Sheltered Route</h3>
                <p>User can select the quickest/sheltered route during differernt weather conditions by simply pressing
                    on buttons. We give users freedom based on their selections and not affecting their experiences.
                    The feature also connect to other existing features in the app, such as notification.

                <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                <p>The result of the project went good. However, according to the feedback from the professor, we did
                    not implement the weather feature fully with user freedom. By saying that, the feature does not
                    have
                    automatic notification feature when there is weather changes. In the future, I will be looking for
                    more userbility test before the final mockup.
